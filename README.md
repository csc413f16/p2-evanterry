# Project 2
## Description
This project is intended to:

1. teach you how to draw to the android screen 
2. get you to create a builder pattern 
3. get you to use an iterator

Unlike subsequent projects, in this project much of the code is provided 
for you.  If you click the TODO tab at the bottom of Andtroid 
Studio's IDE, you'll see every place that code is expected to go.

To figure out what the code is supposed to do in each method, please
read the documentation that has been written into the code.

Additionally, please look at the instrumented tests located in 
app/src/androidTest to see how tests are written and against what
your code will be tested.

Please note this program will not compile until you have completed
the TODOs correctly.

## Setting up testing
If you do not see a Run/Debug Configuration named "Instrumented":

1. Click on the pulldown menu on the top Android Studio toolbar (should show "app"), and select Edit Configurations.
2. The "Run/Debug Configurations" window should open.  
3. In the upper left of the window, press the + and select Android Tests
4. On the right hand side, name it something  like "Instrumented"
5. For the module select app
6. For the Test, select All In Module
7. Press OK
You should now see an Instrumented option on the pulldown menu where
you started this setup.

## Grading
There are a total of 6 (easy) tests.  Each passed test is worth 16.6 
points.
